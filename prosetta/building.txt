The Building
by Nate Westfall, and the field of green grass I sit on.

Towering above,
with too many stories to count.
Well. 000! It was probably like 15 or so.

Anyway, it was enormous, my estimate: hundred 's of feet tall, with a giant door!
My head, wouldn't even reach the top. Enormous!

Anyway, the sky filled the horizon with a lovely sky blue.
The structure took up 90 percent of my vision.
It's unmoving gray mass,
a testimate to the engineering skill needed,
to make a legitimately massive tower!

And it was a massive tower. Literally a great skyscraper..
A rectangular prism so enormous and so massive, 
that it caused the earth around it to sink!
Its walls almost subsided 80 centermeters since it was built!
Crazy right!

Anyway, its blue fiberglass windows contrasted 
the otherwise grey exterior.
Its earthmoving prowess was done via 
its almost shoudlder-wobbling 190 gigagrams.
A gigagram is a thousand kilograms.

So, the air whistled near the giant windows. You could hear it from the ground outside.
The buildings windows were 20 decimeters wide, 2100 mm high, and 7 cm thick!
The whistle probably occured because it reached the big 10 knot winds high up.
Fairly rarely, but once in a blue moon, you could hear banging as the wind smashed up
against the glass, moving the 20 decimeter wide windows to and fro...



It got removed recently. Demolished. 
Such an display of interesting innovation.
Of gigantic magnificence, 
turned into a pile of concrete dust...

A rectangular prism so literally inconceivably giant. 
Gone with the passage of time.
So enormous, and so massive...

Now there's only a field full of green grass.
